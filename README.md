# Menu Bar Scroller

**Menu Bar Scroller** is a macOS application designed to solve the problem of hidden menu bar items on screens with limited space, such as MacBooks with a notch. It provides a horizontal scrollable interface to access and interact with all your running menu bar status items.

## Features

- **Scrollable Interface**: View all your menu bar items in a convenient horizontal scroll view, ensuring nothing is hidden behind the notch or off-screen.
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with both system items (Control Center, etc.) and third-party applications.
- **Interactive**: Click on any item in the scroller to trigger its menu bar action, just as if you clicked the actual icon.
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically filters out invisible or "ghost" items to keep the view clean.
- **Visual Clarity**: Displays application icons and titles (or descriptions) to easily identify each item.

## Requirements

- macOS 11.0 or later.
- **Accessibility Permissions**: The app requires Accessibility permissions to read the menu bar items and simulate clicks. You will be prompted to grant this permission upon first launch.
